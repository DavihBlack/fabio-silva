 In the description it says that all fields accept alphanumeric characters, so with that information I would ask if accepts special characters too. Email address has an special character, so that can't be invalid.
How much time the user has to change the password?
The 6, 7 and 8 points, in the description needs to be clarified. With this information It seems like the email characters are ok, but user first name and last name, are not. Above in the description, it says  that all fields only accepts between 6 - 30 characters but First Name can only store 10 characters and Last Name can only store 12 characters.
Where will be displayed the user information on the home page?
What are the requirements for the password change? How many characters can be used? It only accepts alphanumeric characters?
Why First and Last Name only accepts the minimum of 6 characters?
